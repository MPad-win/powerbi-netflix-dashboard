✅ Overall Business Recommendations

Based on the content trends and country distribution, Netflix should focus on three key strategic areas:

1. Strengthen High-Growth Production Regions

Countries outside the US—especially India, the UK, and South Korea—show consistent growth in content output.
Netflix should expand partnerships in these regions to diversify the catalog and reduce reliance on the US market.

2. Increase Investment in TV Shows

Although movies dominate the catalog (74%), TV shows drive longer user engagement and retention.
Expanding high-quality TV series in emerging genres can improve watch time and reduce churn.

3. Rebalance Catalog Around Post-2015 Content Surge

The sharp increase in titles after 2015 suggests a shift toward modern content preferences.
Netflix should prioritize promoting and acquiring recent, high-performing titles, while gradually phasing out low-engagement legacy content.
